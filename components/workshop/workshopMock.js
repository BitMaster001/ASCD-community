If students learn history through the arts, couldn't they learn it faster by doing it much more directly? It's essential to recognize that in this recent push for greater school efficiency (e.g., every minute counts), the arts are terribly inefficient. It is dreadfully time consuming to learn visual, musical, and movement arts. A theater group might rehearse for 100 minutes a day for 100 days to put on a single 90-minute play. For other students, long hours over several years are invested, with marginal artistic results. So now the question shifts to, If arts are not efficient, what are they?",

Back in the late '70s and early '80s a myth arose that the arts are just a right-brain frill. This hang-over from the days of the “left brain is logical and the right brain is creative” is dead wrong. Chapters 2–4 present brain-based evidence showing the biological basis for art-making. And not only do the arts engage many areas of the brain (see Figure 1.1), but they also have multiple, far-reaching effects on the learner's mind. This book presents a comprehensive arts-based brain theory. ",

In disciplines such as science the answer to this question is obvious. Learn science, then invent a vaccine like for polio and you're Jonas Salk. But what about the arts? Do they serve clear needs? The answer is yes. The arts promote the understanding and sharing of culture. The arts promote social skills that enhance awareness of others and tolerance of differences. The arts promote unity and harmony. They enhance cognitive and perceptual skills. They serve as vehicles for cultural identity and free expression. At Columbia University, Judith Burton's study of more than 2,000 children found that those in an arts curriculum were far superior in creative thinking, self-concept, problem-solving, self-expression, risk-taking, and cooperation than those who were not (Burton et al., 1999).

Art creates, enhances, and defines culture. The work of two cultural anthropologists (Coe, 1990; Dissayanake, 1988) demonstrates that art-making has been present for thousands of years, and may guide survival. Art-making facilitates the creation of large, strong communities that embody important values.

None of those hold up under scrutiny if you understand the brain. Studies demonstrate that both the arts and sciences use both sides of the brain and, in fact, some of the arts may use more of the brain than most science. Still, to incorporate the elements that lead to better thinkers and better people, I believe elementary and secondary policymakers ought to cut the volume of content in half. Students are asked to learn far too much trivia that they'll never remember past test time. Be honest with yourself. How much subject matter content do you remember from high school? Most would say under 5 percent. Let's learn not to value something just because it is easy to teach, is easy to test, and makes politicians look good.",

Waldorf schools never force reading on students, focusing instead on love of languages and literature. Often children don't learn to read until age 7, 8, or even 9. Students often spend a whole year building a piece of furniture or a musical instrument. Valuable class time is used for community service.

Many arts-related benefits take months or years to show up. But when they do, and they always will, they roar onto center stage with brilliance.

Encourage, as much as you can, the use of swinging, bouncing, swaying, tapping, circling, and marching to music.

Each student was given a keyboard and 10 minutes to compose an original work. Keeping things easy, they all started with middle C and used only the white keys. Researchers tallied the time spent on exploration, development, and practice. All were able to create successfully novel compositions. Whereas the 7-year-olds spent the most time on exploration, the 9–11-year-olds spent more time on development and practice. That may be because the brains of the older children have developed more frontal lobe maturation and increased bridging of the corpus callosum. This maturation allows for greater complexity and the ability to juggle abstractions.",

This process is critical because it is the ability to try out a musical possibility without actually having to compose it. In essence, your brain becomes a musical “sketchpad.” This process is identical to that used by professional musicians and suggests that we may have been underrating the creative ability of our students. Students like to compose and will do it if given the chance. By age 9 they have the basic mental processes in place that musicians have: perception, rhythm, and tonal skills.",

Though far from universally accepted, a basic theory of neuronal ensembles is gaining support from others in relation to other sensory and motor areas (e.g., Calvin, 1996). Patterns of a neural symphony form a plausible model that suggests music has a fast track to engaging and enhancing higher brain activities.",

In one study, scientists found that not only did musicians have far greater coherence compared to nonmusicians, but also females had higher coherence than males (Johnson et al., 1996). One study showed that neural patterns and their sequences may be the building blocks for understanding, appreciating, and engaging music (Sarntheim et al., 1998).",

But just as important, reading, history, geography and even social skills soared by 40 percent. Music-making not only supports the development of math skills, but of all skills, for all kinds of students (Catterall et al., 1999; see Figure 2.3).",

Students were tested on the Purdue Perceptual-Motor Survey and the Torrance Tests of Creativity. This study suggests the value of long-term music programs versus a one-time hit-or-miss approach. Another study found that classical music enhances visual imagery skills (McKinney &amp; Tims, 1995). In a third study, the creativity to embellish potential solutions to mock social problem was enhanced by the use of music (Bryan et al., 1998).",

One study suggests that music improves emotional awareness (Alexander &amp; Beatty, 1996). Notably, early music exposure may help children identify and manage their own emotional states. In another study, children with music exposure were able more to accurately identify their emotions.

Only 4 percent thought the music was causal in their behavior, although 72 percent said that their moods were influenced by music. A separate study of 121 high school students suggested that although heavy metal fans espoused fewer compelling reasons for living and had more thoughts of suicide, subjects also claimed that the music elevated their moods (Scheel &amp; Westefeld, 1999). As has been suggested before, listening to heavy metal music is not causal in suicides or inappropriate behavior, though it raises a red flag for potential destructive behavior (see Took &amp; Weiss, 1994).",

Music-making forces us to create, reflect, bare our souls, ponder, react, and formulate in ways we have never done before. It's a powerful language of expression, whether a student is playing or listening to it. In summary, music-making enhances the systems that allow us to perceive and respond appropriately to a world rich with emotions and complex social structures.",

This suggests that many years of extra finger exercise prompted additional nerve growth. In a study of string players, those who had practiced for the ongest had the greatest changes in their brains (Pantev et al., 1998). There are also physical differences in the corpus callosum. It's as much as 15 percent larger in musicians than in nonmusicians (Schlaug et al., 1995a).",

The experimental group of children received music instruction for 40 minutes a day, five days a week, for seven months. They were tested on reading ability at the outset and the end, and the same teachers were used for both the control and experimental group. The music group scored higher (88th percentile vs. the 72nd percentile) in both the first and second years (Hurwitz et al., 1975). Other studies suggest that music may facilitate awareness and discrimination of sounds, key skills needed for reading.

One group received Suzuki music instruction; the control group did not. After four months, both groups were tested for visual-motor skills, and those in the music group scored higher. This may indicate a solid transfer effect from the music instruction. But did prior music background bias that study? A study by Mozart Effect™ codiscoverer, Francis Rauscher, on rats (with no musical background), showed improved maze-running when exposed to music versus nonmusical controls (Rauscher, Robinson, &amp; Jason, 1998; see Figure 2.10). This finding is intriguing. In mammals that do not get any exposure to music, prolonged music exposure improved their intelligence, compared to those who get no music exposure. Although it's not a human study, it suggests that music may have some long-term effects on intelligence.",

In Hungary, where math and science scores top the those of the United States by a wide margin, the Kodaly Method emerged from the work of Zoltan Kodaly. The Kodaly schools use a method of singing in perfect pitch, starting with folk songs. Later, students read any piece of music and sing something that was composed for an instrument in perfect pitch. This attention to sounds pays off. The Kodaly Method has grown worldwide, and the students become good overall learners (for more information, see Organization of American Kodaly Educators, OAKE, 2000).",

The group sings for presidents, at Carnegie Hall, at Academy Awards shows, and other events. Membership means extra work every day to participate. Does this activity add to student workloads and reduce time for keeping up in their studies? Yes—but it seems to motivate them to work harder. The Harlem group's results are attention getting.

The students tested were developmentally delayed in vocabulary and language and did have related musical activities with the singing (Hoskins, 1988). In normal children, a study was done with 3-year-olds who got twice-weekly instruction over a three-year period. The control group got regular preschool programs. There were no measurable differences in IQ scores, typically weighted toward math and memory. The other results, however, were remarkable. The singing experimental group improved motor development coordination, abstract conceptual thinking, improvisation, verbal abilities, and creativity (Kalmar, 1982).",

Music has assisted runners in improving training times. Among competitive swimmers, music has improved performance. Other studies have supported the prudent and purposeful use of music for exercise enhancement. The heavy, pumping rhythmic music enhances strength; and the calming, relaxing, soothing music actually weakens our muscle strength. These studies and others suggest that music gets at the core of our rhythms, motivation, and overall performance.",

The entire body, when in a natural state of rest, vibrates at approximately 8 cycles per second. Our bodies are living oscillators that receive and create vibrations. These are translated through roots of the auditory nerves, which are widely distributed and possess more extensive connections than those of any other nerve in the body (see Figure 2.11).",

In addition, many scientific studies have shown that music does, in fact, lower the levels of the stress hormone cortisol and increase antibodies in children (see Lane, 1992).",

One was the radio, another tones and clicks, another was Muzak; and the controls got silence. After 30 minutes, the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) were measured. Of the four conditions tested, only Muzak lowered the IgA levels. This strengthening of the immune system can be helpful in two ways. First, many students arrive at school already in a distressed condition, so it can be a brief treatment for some. For others, particularly those who commonly live with suboptimal conditions that predispose one to illness, strengthening the immune system may be especially helpful. If music exposure could regulate cortisol or steroid levels, the value would be tremendous. Estimates range from 3 to 5 percent of school-age children who have some form of depression, depending on their age. Considering that school-age depression is a significant problem, and cortisol is the peptide of negative expectations, it's no wonder so many students turn to music—it's a form of self-medication—it regulates moods!",

They used a rhythmic Strauss waltz; a nonrhythmic piece by a modern composer, Henze; and a highly rhythmic selection by an Indian artist, Ravi Shankar. Of the three, the one with the highest musical predictability was the third, the Ravi Shankar piece. It was the one that reduced cortisol and noradrenaline levels, too (Mockel et al., 1994).",

In one study, following high-intensity exercise, runners listened to one of two types of music: sedative, fast (Techno-pop), or no music (control). The group of runners who heard the fast music experienced increased levels of stress hormones, whereas the other two conditions showed no rise in cortisol (Brownley, McMurray, &amp; Hackney, 1995). Evidence suggests there may be a universal response to high beats-per-minute music—stress levels rise! And under certain controlled conditions, that may be good if an adrenaline response is needed.",

Music improves the spatial learning in ways that suggest learners may be able to solve related problems. There's a carry-over to reading skills from music instruction (Benson et al., 1997). Twenty-seven kindergartners participated in a program that brought music into their whole-language reading program. Three groups were divided into (1) spoken text rehearsal, (2) song rehearsal of their text only, and (3) spoken and song rehearsal of their text. The test consisted of recalling the text readings, then analyzing for mistakes in substitution and omission. The two groups using music proved far superior to the text-only group (Colwell, 1994). This finding supports the long-standing premise that music facilitates verbal memory.",

He discovered that a listening program consisting of filtered and unfiltered music and voice received both actively and passively for 60–75 hours changed how the subject's brain heard. The Tomatis Method, as it has become known, trains the ear (auditory system in the brain) until the listener can retain the skills without additional training (Thompson &amp; Andrews, 1999; see Figure 2.14).",

Tomatis says that sound provides an electrical charge that energizes the brain. He has devised an auditory-stimulation process that identifies various dysfunctional physical or motivational systems related to listening, hearing, communicating, and movement, and corrects them via specially filtered classical music, including that of Mozart, as well as selected chants.",

Tomatis's position is that the ear is a major integrator of the nervous system. Many believe that hyperactive children may be in a constant state of motion as a means of “charging up” their brain. We know that movement stimulates the vestibular system; and this theory would help explain the calming effect music can have on hyperactive children. On the other hand, lethargic students can benefit from music's recharging influence on the nervous system.",

Abraham Maslow said, “The arts are far closer to the core of education than are the more exalted subjects.” They can help construct our meaning—represent our world in ways that cannot come through linear teaching. The award-winning neurologist Semir Zeki (1999, p. 94) says, “No theory of aesthetics is likely to be complete, let alone profound, unless it is based on an understanding of the workings of the brain.”",

Imagine having to think through many potential decisions as a heavy object is being thrown at your head. Any cognitive delay may cost you your life. The ideal evolutionary course is to have both: cognition for flexibility, instinct for speed, and intuition to combine the two. But how would one develop and express intuition? Visual arts may be the perfect vehicle to do that. It exercises our creative, intuitive faculties in a way that science, language, or math might never do. Art-making is the realization of our intuition in the physical world.",

Two researchers discovered that unless feline eyes have normal exposure to a typical upbringing, the visual system may develop in strange ways. Hubel and Wiesel's (1970) experiments, for which they were awarded the Nobel prize, revealed that when deprived of a world of vertical lines, cats will grow up unable to see them. Their brain, like ours, has a critical period for development. These researchers also discovered how our neurons are organized into columns, which respond to the environment by activating and stimulating neurons. Although it is entirely inappropriate to do experiments like those on humans, the prudent speculation is that our visual system also has both critical and sensitive periods for development. In cats, this initial critical period is within the first three months. This is the time we learn edges, contrast, and lines.",

Over time, drawers grow from connected objects to hierarchically organized ones, then architectural solutions, and potentially random improvised solutions (Greenfield &amp; Schneider, 1977; see Figure 3.1). The visual cortex has matured as children have plenty of time outdoors, where they can learn, in the real world, how to judge and accurately estimate depth and distances. Some children spend too much time in front of a television. That's not good for developing eyes. They need the experiences that real life affords (Healy, 1994).",

The retina's ganglion layer contains the cells and pathways that form your optic nerves.

In general, the parietal lobe processes the spatial layout, the temporal lobes the names and memory, and the occipital lobe processes color, movement, contrast, form, and other critical elements of vision. But the frontal lobes are involved in both the attentional process and the decisions about how long to look at the art. In short, visual art-making and seeing are a whole-brained experience (Barker &amp; Barasi, 1999; Zeki, 1993). Your visual system has more than 35 areas for processing.

It does this by developing biases as you grow up. You learned that a picture is not reality; it's a flattened, smaller version of it. These biases become 3-D construction rules. Your brain simply constructs a world that you see according to a set of rules you learned. If you didn't have rules, your brain would construct your visual options randomly; and the result would be flips, distortions, flattening, and other oddities that would wreak havoc with your sanity. In fact, many of the rules of art are embedded into art software tools. Students can create animated demonstrations on the computer.

In short, we cannot see distance, we construct the probability that items are farther, based on rules of proportionality in object size. But there's much more. Once we have depth, we have to add to the scene things like color, texture, or movement. All these are added based on our individual experience in the real world. We respond to color in a way that is both gene regulated and experience driven. Visualizing requires both sides of the brain, and image generation is critically dependent on the left as well as the right hemisphere (Posner &amp; Raichle, 1994).",

Humans are different from other species: We do art for the mere pleasure of it. Making and observing visual art seems to enhance our ability to elicit and even mediate our emotional responses. The areas most involved in our brains that facilitate this development include the thalamus, amygdala, and reward pathway from the top of the brain stem through to the ventral frontal lobes. What gets the greatest emotional response is both the familiar and the bizarre. Different types of art (e.g., familiar vs. unfamiliar) will activate different areas of the brain.

The results showed a significant increase in spatial visualization skills (Kyle, 1990). “Making art is a highly cognitive process that involves problem-solving, critical thinking and creative thinking,” says Professor Edward Sturr of Kansas State University.

Sometimes repetition and a new representation of the learning will strengthen the memories. In fact, drawing arts can help establish, diagnose, and retrain memory problems in learners. One way to enhance student vocabulary and writing ability is to use art as the medium for analysis. While learning to critique art, students can increase their vocabulary and language skills. Drawing forces us to visualize and plan our actions. In a recent study, drawing figures helped improve thinking skills and verbal skills in children with learning disabilities (Jing, Yuan, &amp; Liu, 1999).",

Art gives feelings a form—and an opportunity to manipulate that form. If we feel bad about something, through art we can change the representation of those feelings and, both metaphorically and physically, change those feelings as they're expressed. We want to encourage the expression of art, because it's the expression of our students. And to most effective teachers, what students have to say is important, indeed.",

Cohen and Gainer demonstrate that art is a highly effective way of improving reading, classroom behavior, and the overall quality of learning.

Successful in his career, he now provides inner-city high school kids with an arts education and gives back what his arts teacher gave him—affection, decency, and hope. “My arts teacher saved my life,” said Bill Strickland, who, 25 years later, is an architect and now a trustee of the University of Pittsburgh (cited in Terry, 1998, p. 170).",

The researchers used specialized instruments to assess both the artistic development and cognitive changes.

Pre- and post-surveys were done to measure student values and appreciation of alternative art versus traditional Western art. The results suggested that the cultural awareness part of the course significantly improved student learning and awareness (Gomez-Shafer, 1990). Another teacher used written assignments and learning logs as part of the art evaluations. Student attitudes did change over time to become more open minded about alternative art forms. But the surprise was that vocabulary and writing skill increased (Campeau, 1990).",

They were also given a timed writing exam of written art assessment.

You construct what you see, what you smell, what you taste, what you hear, and even what you feel (Hoffman, 1998). Nothing is the way it is, without an interpretation. Our brain learns to see, hear, and feel through the experiences we have. In short, our everyday existence depends on the creative interpretation of our brain. The arts facilitate this process more fully than any other discipline. The most valued skills, the talents in highest demand in this new century, will be creativity, imagination, and emotional expression. These are all fostered by the arts.

Unless students have access to stimulating arts activities, they're cut off from many ways to perceive the world. In many ways, the learner is going backward. Although significant time investments are often required to gain potent results from physical education and music-making, visual arts give you an immediate return with little investment. Art classes are an important feature in any curriculum, but the greatest payback comes from integrating visual arts into the curriculum. Estimates are that we receive over 90 percent of our information visually. When students can't do visual arts, we've shut off a big part of their world.",

That's a mistaken position. Instead my purpose is to explore the strengths of kinesthetic arts for student learning and determine how to optimize their potential. The kinesthetic arts play a powerful role as a universal language, with a symbolic way of representing the world. They let us communicate with others, demonstrate human experiences, show insights, and solve common problems. Kinesthetic arts also allow us to better understand other cultures and provide for our health and emotional expression. Movement, dance, physical education, and theater all comprise a different kind of learning—not just different from a lecture, but sometimes better. Kinesthetic arts may enhance cognition, positive attitudes, and confidence; in some cases, kinesthetic arts may grow new brain cells.",

And each movement, in turn, activates cortical areas. Because each specific muscle has to get the message at a slightly different time, it's a bit like a well-timed explosion conducted by a special-effects team.

More complex movements, like drumming, cutting wood, or running, engage sequences that are controlled at the other subcortical levels, like the basil ganglia and cerebellum. But highly complex and novel movements involve most of the brain. We suddenly must make rapid decisions, keep our attention up, monitor our emotions, remember our past, be alert for potential problems, create solutions on the spot, keep our balance, watch the expression of other faces, move quickly and gracefully—and somehow still remember the point of the activity. All these locomotor, manipulative, and cognitive activities are linked with developmental stages and academic learning at each grade level (Corso, 1997).",

Students with four or more years in dance were 27 points higher, those in drama study 44 points higher, and those with acting or production experience were a whopping 53 points higher than nondramatic arts students on the averaged math and verbal scores (College Board, 2000).",

One of the activities that both theater and dance students are asked to do is improvise. This may prime the brain for new ideas and the will to carry them out. Rarely is this creative behavior rewarded in a typical pencil-and-paper classroom. Completely untried and novel ideas, however, are more likely to be rewarded in a dramatic arts curriculum or play rehearsal.",

Students also learn compositional structure, sequencing, collaboration skills, and interpretation. The qualities of rhythm, coherence, and flow are introduced and refined. Students learn technical skills, including artistic problem-solving, time-space issues, emotional impact, and the logistics of production work. All of these can enhance self-concept.",

In a 4th grade class, kids created a huge playground map of the United States and literally ran from state to state, learning to identify them by movements. In another part of the study, 10 high schools were offered Shakespeare instruction. The nearly 800 students in the program, almost unanimously, reported that they developed a strong sense of their own capacities. In addition, many said their success with Shakespeare carried over to other complex works of literature, math, and physics (Leroux &amp; Grossman, 1999). In one study in Seattle, Washington, 3rd grade students studied language arts concepts through dance activities.

The difficulty schools face is that this “golden time” for motor development at ages 2–6 is more likely to be underdeveloped than it is to be normal. We have an increasingly sedentary population. Fortunately, dance routines often include spinning, leaping, crawling, rolling, rocking, pointing, and matching.

In a recent study, children (4- and 5-year-olds) were divided into four groups: (1) independent study (control group), (2) verbal instructions, (3) verbal instruction plus acting out the related movement, and (4) instructions given in song with music—and movements done in the form of a dance. After 20 days of learning, the assessment given was the Torrence Test of Creative Thinking. The group getting the highest scores were the music and dance group (group 4); and the other experimental groups (2 and 3) beat the control group (group 1), too (Mohanty &amp; Hejmadi, 1992).",

A common perception of both children and adolescents is that “the world happens to me.” They believe that how they feel and what they believe is all happening to them (vs. generated by them). As a result, this lessened sense of self-efficacy and empowerment often leads to depression. But students who participate in the movement arts learn that they have control over how they feel. They learn, for example, that dance makes them feel good. They learn that after a walk, they feel better. The feel-good chemicals of noradrenaline and dopamine are running higher in the brain, and that's good for learning and well-being.",

Industrial art-making does many things for us, including developing the brain and giving us a sense of self-control over our world. Brain activity and working with our hands is so interdependent, so synergistic and complex, that no single brain theory can adequately account for it (see Figure 4.5). The hand speaks to the brain as much as the brain speaks to the hand. With 39 muscles in1 the hand and forearm, the neural complexity of the simplest movement is staggering.",

All of these movements force an individual to make choices that matter: You fix it or it stays broken, you build it or you never get to own it, you stand or fall, you catch the ball or get hit in the face, you run a race or lose face. This helps to reconnect cause and effect. Next, a teacher needs to ensure that this kind of healing process stays engaged over time; months are better than weeks.

In other words, we don't become smart by always making the right choice—we become smart by eliminating bad choices. Researchers say, “Playing animals, including humans, are motivated to repeat newly acquired skills in the absence of immediate external goals, thereby increasing the strength of neurological structures underlying these skills and opening opportunities for further learning” (Byers &amp; Walker, 1995). The same games that a 4-year-old is playing—such as jumping over a puddle, skipping rope, and playing make-believe—are later turned into real-world activities. The adolescent, soon-to-be-an-adult, can now play a sport, dodge a skateboard left in the driveway, and mentally rehearse an upcoming conversation with the opposite sex (McCune, 1998).",

He was in the Boy Scouts and served as altar boy, but that was a duty, forced on him by his father. Teachers said he slumped against the wall at recess and never joined in with the other kids. His parents closely controlled and regimented his after- school time. Charles never had time to express his inner world. That is, until August 1, 1966, when he finally expressed himself. On that day, Charles Whitman climbed up and into the clock tower at the University of Texas at Austin and began shooting people with a high-powered rifle. He was stopped almost three hours later, leaving a campus littered with dead and wounded bodies. Play would have been a far healthier alternative for Charles. Maybe he could have expressed his emotions in a nonlethal way. Remember, your students will always express themselves, it's just a matter of when and how.",

In the province of Quebec in Canada, a study of 546 primary schoolchildren was done to determine the effects, if any, of one hour a day of physical education. The results were robust. The experimental group significantly outperformed the controls at grades 2, 3, 5, and 6 (Shephard, 1996). In Farmington Hills, Michigan, 1st grade teacher Barry Nofzinger did action research on two groups, the experimental physical education group of 22 children and 21 who were the controls. The Wood Creek Elementary students were ability and grade matched. Pre- and post- attitudinal surveys were given, and the study lasted four weeks. The results suggest that physical education is responsible for improved self-concept, enhanced academics, and enjoying school more. What more could you ask from a program that does that much and costs almost nothing? (Nofzinger, personal communication, June 26, 1999).",

There are ambiguous links to academic performance when taught after age 6, though there may be other benefits that have not been measured, or may be unmeasurable. Many of the studies that demonstrate the value of perceptual-motor activities among elementary or secondary age learners have inadequate or no experimental controls.

It functions best with a steady stream of micro information packages, with pauses for processing, like recess. Give students small chunks of information, processing time, then a rest from the material. This allows the neurons to better “wire together” for longer-lasting memory formation (Spitzer, 1999).",

As far back as 1912, Maria Montessori described the impact of introducing chairs to school: “Children were not disciplined, but annihilated” (Benton, 1986, p. 787). Though the height of children has been increasing over the past few decades, chairs have been shrinking. Keep in mind, children's visual focus distance is less than that of adults, averaging 12 inches. As a result, they compensate by leaning over, rounding their backs and creating strain. Students need slanted desks, rolled front seat edges, and foot rests. Realistically, investing in quality chairs for students won't happen. The alternative is teachers who understand the value of movement as a part of the learning process.",

Results from kindergarten and remedial learning settings suggest that sensory stimulation affected all learners, but those with the least deficits made the most progress. There was no differences noted in age. While these activities are not appropriate for adolescent and adult learners, they do make sense for younger students.",

Gross motor movements, like walking or swimming, increase dopamine production, one of the brains' reward chemicals. The most likely effects are an immediate increase of the feel-good chemicals like dopamine, plus an increase of adrenaline and endorphins. Exercise is known to modulate the body's levels of serotonin, our mood stabilizer. The secondary effects occur when one gains more control and even mastery over one's body. This can stimulate the body's production of endorphins (Pert, 1997).",

A large study from the Heschong Mahone Consulting Group in Sacramento, California, verified this—and caught the eye of the popular press. Researchers examining light and productivity studied 21,000 students in three states for academic performance. Every single classroom was rated from 1 to 6 based on how much illumination students received. The daylight, not direct sunlight, is what students benefited from the most. Students in the brightest classrooms (better skylights and more natural lighting) scored 20–25 percent higher on reading and math scores than did students in the poorly lit classrooms. Researchers are not yet sure how to account for this difference, though they suspect that the light regulates mood, hormones, and visual acuity (Heschong Mahone, 1999; see also Cooper, 1999; see Figure 4.9).",

The researchers designed a 10-year experiment and selected a portion of the students for a special program.

The experiment ran for seven months, and researchers used moral development indicators (Horrock's Prosocial Play Behavior Inventory) for pre- and post-testing. Fair Play for Kids is a teacher resource manual and interdisciplinary program that focuses on moral development. The results showed that the children's moral reasoning skills improved significantly in the two experimental groups, but that the control group's did not (Gibbons, Ebbeck, &amp; Weiss, 1995).

The point here is not to discourage any competition, but to encourage some follow-up activities (like walks, stretching, or yoga) that might calm down the system.

Thayer suggests, aside from mandated vigorous exercise, that going for brisk walks is the single best way teachers can influence student's moods. A consistent physical education program not only puts students in better moods, but generally improves achievement.",

For the past 100 years, one of the so-called immutable laws of brain science was that the human brain cannot grow new cells (neurogenesis). This dogma was shattered by the work of Fred Gage and his team from The Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. The exciting new discoveries in neurogenesis tell us that humans can and do grow new brain cells daily. To discover what enhances new neuron growth, Gage's colleague, Henriette van Praag, used rats with four different experimental conditions. She discovered that running (versus swimming, learning, control, or enriched environment) is the top brain-cell producer (van Praag, Kempermann, &amp; Gage, 1999; see Figure 4.11). Moreover, four weeks later, more of the new neurons survived (from running) and became functional. While we await studies on humans, if you needed a good excuse to exercise, gaining new neurons may be as good as it gets.",

Some programs need better planning; others need more meaning, choice, and purpose. Some programs need goals and supervision, too.

Many studies suggest that physical activity provides a slew of benefits that are well worth the investment (e.g., Caterino &amp; Polak, 1999; Shephard, 1997). If you're looking for miracles, look no further. There is also a clear mandate for the implementation of programs early on, because the effects are greater in the early years.

To make disciplines like arts more explicit borders on the ludicrous. “Name five painters from the Impressionist Era.” Arts are not that simple.

Do the arts help develop the brain? Are there special age groups important for introducing the arts to children? The book considers these and other questions that explore the value of the arts in education.",

The questions and reflection points can be used by a person reading the book alone, but are best discussed with a colleague or members of a study group. The guide will provide the most benefit if you work on the study questions and activities after finishing each chapter. (However, many have found that by previewing the questions first, then the additional \"mind set\" helps activate the brain in searching and making connections.)
