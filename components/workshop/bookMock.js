They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before the first board is nailed into place. The gardeners, by contrast, dig a hole, drop in a seed, water it, and wait. They kind of know what seed it isâ€”if they planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed, or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they continue to water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have; they find out as it grows (cited in Flood, 2011). Martin explains that he, himself, is a gardener.",

While there are absolutely fits and starts and changes of direction along the way, the theme and line of logic I envision act as a compass that generally keeps me on course. In those settings, I write as an architect, knowing what the structure needs to look like and crafting a blueprint that will get me where I was sure from the outset I needed to go. In other instances, I begin with a sort of ideaâ€”fuzzy, perhaps, but still promisingâ€”a seed that I plant and tend along the way. In those instances, I write more as a gardener, and I plow a lot of mud as I go. Over time, and in a generally stepwise fashion, however, I can see the seed sprout, grow, and ultimately appear worthy of harvest.",

That was made more problematic by expert conclusions that (1) differentiation and personalization are the same, (2) differentiation is a kind of personalization, and (3) personalization is a kind of differentiation. To complicate things further, there was a body of writing on technology-based \"personalization\"â€”a whole different breed of animal. In the end, I found so many misconceptions about differentiation that, combined with the amorphous \"consensus\" on both human-centered and tech-driven personalization, I had neither a blueprint nor a garden.",

It's been characterized as inquiry, as project-based, as Genius Hour, and as the outcome of community engagement. It's been explained as making sure all students have access to the same materials and as ensuring that students can select materials with which they want to work. I thought a great deal about the reality that differentiation looks quite different in a teacher-directed classroom than it does in a classroom where students are partners in design and decision making. I pondered how personalization would morph among project-based, mastery-based, inquiry-based, and test-focused classrooms. Maybe, I concluded, what I really wanted to write about was how our definition of curriculum necessarily shapes how we think about instruction.",

But I also know in both my brain and my bones that we cannot be the educators we want to be, or help learners become the people they dream of being, by adding a new emphasis, a \"new\" strategy, to our current practice, which in the test-prep era, seems scarcely concerned with quality in the first place.

Over the two decades since test scores became the currency of success in schools (a currency that is quite scarce, as it happens), we have had little impetus or time to think about the nature of learning environments that make school safe and compelling for young people. In too many schools, we've had no opportunity to understand what it means to create meaningful curriculum because lists of standards and pacing guides have taken the place of actual curriculum. We have talked some about promising assessment practices that might inform instructional approaches, but we have been so busy with the standardized tests and the interim tests designed to result in better scores on the standardized tests that there seems to have been little heart for more assessment. Instructional quality has taken a back seat to covering curriculum, adhering to pacing guides, and teaching information and skills easily assessed by filling in bubbles. \"In the interest of time,\" students' strengths, interests, needs, and dreams have too often remained invisible.

I hope this book will be helpful to all teachers who seek to build trust in themselves and in their students, who want to explore content for its significance, who want to develop systems that help clarify each student's learning trajectory as it evolves over the course of a school year, and who want to steadily increase students' voices in their own learning.",

I invite you to think along with me as I explore how high-quality, foundational classroom practices might be marshaled to increase student voice and agency in the classroom and in students' lives beyond the classroom. It's my hope that in doing so, you will extend your own agency and voice as well.",

At various points, my students and I took photographs of common objects around the school grounds or in classrooms or at home, selecting things that had personal meaning for us or evoked strong feelings. We talked about camera angles, backgrounds, light, depth of field, and color. We planned how to communicate the feeling we wanted to share. We made slide presentations of the photographs and selected background music that gave voice to the images we selected. Later, we'd assemble images that illuminated for ourselves the works of famous poets. We wrote \"insta-poems\" to instrumental music and came to understand the power of sound and words to capture meaning. And we polished our favorite works by using what we were learning about figures of speech, rhythm, grammar, and so on to make the poems \"pop.\" Many of the 12-year-olds in my classroom became fast fans of a literary form they'd previously found off-putting or dismissed out of hand.",

Sometimes I asked the students to develop an idea that seemed intriguing and challenging. One example of that happened in my fourth year as a junior high English teacher, when I asked them to think about what we could do to make literature come alive for them. They surprised (and terrified) me when, almost in unison, they said we should put on a play for the public. I knew only a little more than they did about how to make that happen, so we watched plays, studied criteria for excellent performances, set standards for our work, selected a play, cast it, figured out how to do make-up and lighting, rehearsed exhaustively, and invited the outside world to come see us. Throughout all of that, we had continual conversations about protagonists, antagonists, rising and falling action, themes, oral expression, and dozens of other \"non-negotiables\" for the year's curriculum. It wasn't necessary to underline or copy examples of literary terms from an anthology; these ideas became standard vocabulary for usâ€”and the words took on a purpose as they helped us think about our work like professionals would. We surprised ourselves and our audiences with the strength of our work. That marked the beginning of about 15 years of dinner theater productions at our school. They grew in scope and quality every year, because every year, we set out to make that happen. As time went on, parents signed on to support us in varied ways, but students remained at the center of acting, set design, make-up, costuming, lighting, advertising, and all of the other roles it takes to make a high-quality drama unfold for audiences. That process did, in fact, make literature in varied forms live for us and in us.",

Students could determine how long they wanted to work on their chosen project (9, 12, or 18 weeks), depending on their goals and the complexity of the task they had defined for themselves. Classes, of course, continued while the independent work hummed along in the background.

Common across the performance tasks was the requirement to demonstrate their proficiency with the skills of inquiryâ€”gathering and analyzing background information, setting goals, defining task parameters, delineating criteria for success, establishing timelines, reflecting on progress and outcomes, getting input and guidance from knowledgeable individuals or sources, executing their plans, evaluating and learning from outcomes, and sharing their work with relevant audiences.",

Their work included looking at costs, materials, safety standards, building codes, and proposed designsâ€”and they found some noteworthy concerns with the design under construction. Ultimately, they took their concerns and alternative plans to a local governing board, along with illustrative photos, charts, diagrams, and architectural sketches. The planning body listened attentively, asked questions, thanked the students for their thoughtful work, and promised to study the information the students had presented. That was affirming and exciting for the young adolescentsâ€”but not nearly as rewarding as it was when the new school opened the following year and the students saw that the initial access plan has been replaced with a safer one they had suggested.",

Then, in a sort of instinctive Montessori-like approach, she worked with the students to figure out ways in which they might best be able to find success.

They found and developed their individual strengths and used those strengths to help them bridge weaker spots. The students also met as a whole class often, sharing their ideas, thinking, process, and progress. They felt capable and comfortable. Hard work was a core ethic in the class, but the work was designed to help students succeed in learningâ€”and to grow as learners.

He points out that a person who cares to sustain good health takes care, over the span of a year, to eat wisely, exercise, sleep adequately, take necessary medicines, and so forth. Once a year, that person is likely to go to a physician to get a read on how his or her health is looking. If the physician has changes to recommend, the person is likely to listen to the recommendations, discuss them with the doctor, and implement the changes in a responsible way. Jay says that at some point in the relatively recent past, we turned that sequence on its head in schools. Instead of faithfully \"living a healthy life\" and \"checking in with the doctor annually\" to see how we're doing, we've begun practicing for the physical throughout the yearâ€”all but abandoning a day-to-day focus on what it means to live well. In other words, we have jettisoned \"healthy\" teaching and learning and are in a constant state of test prep. The two approaches are cataclysmically different.",

This mandate required testing every student in math and reading every year from 3rd through 8th grade and once in high school. Schools that didn't make an adequate showing faced a series of consequences, which prompted those schools (and others) to add new standardized tests during the year to make sure their students would be ready for the mandated end-of-grade tests.

A single-minded focus on standardized test scores has encouraged \"teaching to the tests\" at the cost of creativity and in-depth learning. Mandating standardized tests in certain subjects has diminished attention to and the importance of subjects that are not tested (Kâ€“12 Academics, n.d.).",

We follow that path not because it results in the most robust curriculum we can envision to engage young minds and prepare them for a complex world, but because those things are most easily tested and, thus, most likely to appear on the year-end standardized test that has become the touchstone for what happens in the classroom.",

And yet, as Anna Aldric (2018) documents, mean math and reading scores on the SAT in 1994 and 2016 suggest otherwise, showing a very small increase in reading (from 504 to 509) and a parallel, very small decrease in math (from 499 to 494) over that time span. The SAT was revised in 2016, and scores from the new test were first reported 2017. Although SAT scores from 2017 and 2018 are comparable with each other, they cannot be compared with 2007 and 2016 scores. But we can see that since the revised test was first administered, mean scores for all SAT-takers have fallen slightly in both math (from 531 to 528) and reading (from 536 to 531). As shown in Figure 1.1, the mean composite SAT score of White students rose modestly during the nearly 10-year span between 2007 and 2016 and fell modestly between 2018 and 2019. During the same periods, mean SAT scores of Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino/Latin American students showed similar minor movement; however, for these traditionally underserved demographic groups, that movement was downward in both periods (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019; National Center for Fair & Open Testing, 2019).",

The chart you see in Figure 1.2 shows the percentage of students who scored at the \"Proficient or Above\" level (which is generally seen as a higher standard than \"average\" performance) on the 2014 NAEP in grades 4, 8, and 12 in seven content areas (The Nation's Report Card, n.d.). It would seem to be a reasonable hope that at least half of school-age students would be at least \"Proficient\" in the key content areas. However, the best performances in this graphic are in 4th grade math, reading, and science, where little more than a third of students perform at or above the Proficient level.

At least a quarter of students scored below \"Basic\" level, indicating they did not possess the skills to handle the content. In history, 34 percent of students fell below Basic, and in geography, the \"Below Basic\" showing was 29 percent. In the years between 2014 and 2018, scores in all categories tested fell, with the exception being civics, where scores have remained low over time, gaining only 3 points since the test was first administered in 1998. Less than a third of students tested scored at or above Proficient on the testâ€”and in history, that number was just 15 percent. Further, the 2018 NAEP shows a highly concerning patternâ€”namely, a broad-based and growing gulf between top performers on the test and those who struggle most significantly. This disparity registers on virtually all standardized measures and should provide more than ample evidence that what we have been doing in U.S. schools for the last two decades is not working to reverse inequitable schooling and prepare students of all backgrounds to be productive, contributing, and fulfilled members of their communities and of the nation as a whole.",

Progress in narrowing the Hispanicâ€“White gap has been more evident than progress in shrinking the African Americanâ€“White gap. At the same time, the \"poverty gap\" has remained stubbornly persistent and, in some cases, has increased. Overall, the authors say, large gaps remain, representing differences of approximately one and a half years of normal academic progress. They conclude, \"Unless we rapidly increase the rates at which we close our race-, ethnicity-, and income-based gaps, unequal access to education and the consequences of this inequality will affect students today as well as subsequent generations\" (para. 15).",

To make matters worse, the study found no correlation between the amount of testing in a district and the way its students perform on the NAEP exam, which is the only consistent measure of student achievement across state lines. The study describes the testing scene as \"a-chock-a-block jumble\" (para. 8), where tests have been layered upon tests as a result of mandates, further exacerbated by aggressive marketing of the tests by the companies that produce them.

These scores reflect an 11-point drop for U.S. students since the previous administration of the PISA in math, with flat performance over the same time period in science and reading (Jackson &amp; Kiersz, 2016). When PISA scores for the test administered in 2018 were released in 2019, students in the U.S. appeared to show a bit of improvement in reading and science while declining in math (OECD, 2019). In fact, notes Peggy Carr, associate commissioner for the National Center on Education Statistics, the scores remained flat from 2015 results, and U.S. student scores looked a little better only because scores in a few other countries slipped slightly. \"We have remained steady and so our ranking has improvedâ€”not exactly the way you want to improve your ranking\" (in Sparks, 2019, para. 3). The 2018 PISA results indicated that average U.S. scores hadn't changed significantly in reading or math since the test was first given in 2000 (Barshay, 2019).",

The mason jar sat on the teacher's desk; the big moth emerged inside it. The moth had clawed out, as if agonizingly, over the course of an hour, one leg at a time; we children watched around the desk, transfixed. After it emerged, the wet, mashed thing turned around walking on the green jar's bottom, then painstakingly climbed the twig with which the jar was furnished. There, at the twig's top, the moth shook its sodden clumps of wings. When it spread those wingsâ€”those beautiful wingsâ€”blood would fill their veins, and the birth fluids on the wings' frail sheets would harden to make them though as sails. But the moth could not spread its wide wings at all; the jar was too small. The wings could not fill, so they hardened while they were still crumpled from the cocoon.",

It would have been as big as a wren. The teacher let the deformed creature go. We all left the classroom and paraded outside behind the teacher with pomp and circumstance. She bounced the moth from its jar and set it on the school's asphalt driveway. The moth set out walking. It could only heave the golden wrinkly clumps where its wings should have been; it could only crawl down the school driveway on its six frail legs. The moth crawled the driveway toward the rest of Shadyside. It crawled down the driveway because its shriveled wings were glued shut. I watched it go. I knew that this particular moth, the big walking moth, could not travel more than a few more yards before a bird or a cat began to eat it, or a car ran over it. Nevertheless, it was crawling with what seemed wonderful vigor, as if, I thought at the time, it was still excited from being born. I watched it go till the bell rang and I had to go in.",

And yet, it is an apt analogy for both the student and teacher experience in a great number of classrooms since the press for raising standardized test scores established a chokehold on classroom practice. In those classrooms, students and teachers alike have too often lived out their school careers in jars that were too small to enable them to stretch their wingsâ€”to become their best selves, to thrive outside the jar, to soar. Curriculum constricted by test myopia has narrowed instructional options and, in many ways, dehumanized both learners and teachers. Even absent high-stakes testing and what it represents in terms of dehumanization and constriction of human potential, the classrooms many students enter each day are ones where educators and peers perceive them to be misaligned with schooling because of their race, language, exceptionality, culture, or economic status. For these students, the mason jar is even smaller and more injurious. As a nation, as members of a school faculty, and as individual educators, we have a defining need to do all we canâ€”even against prevailing windsâ€”to discard the jar and to release both the young people in our care and ourselves from its crippling confines. As the title of this book conveys, we do this so that each of us, all of us, may soar.",

And, of course, students' varied strengths, dreams, experiences, and cultures will shape how they might develop these attributes and how they would apply them in daily life.

They can be used in ways that elicit student motivation or damp down its flames. They can be used to open the universe to young people or confine them in the mason jar. In the end, our goal isâ€”or should beâ€”creating classrooms designed to help students from all backgrounds and experiences soar: flourish cognitively, affectively, and socially in classrooms designed to guide each to reach and then push beyond what previously appeared to be the ceiling of possibilities. Learning opportunities in these classrooms should also enable each student to be the best possible member of the classroom community of learners and, ultimately, of all the broader communities in which the student participates.",

The teachers attempt to get a sense of what each student knows, cares about, is able to do, and wants to do\" (quoted in National Research Council, 2000, p. 136). Van Manen (1991) makes the same point in a similar way, asserting that in a student-focused classroom, the teacher works to develop a sense of who the learner is now as well as who the learner may become. The work of teaching, then, becomes collaborating with the young person to construct a sturdy and reliable bridge between \"now\" and \"then.\"",

An effect size of 1.0 suggests 3 years of advancement at the end of a school yearâ€”an impact rarely demonstrated in research. Hattie identifies any approach or strategy that results in an effect size of 0.4 as highly desirableâ€”one worthy of attention as we try to create classrooms that build student capacity.",

It is about modifying our understanding of the intent and nature of teaching to be reaching each student equitably and then acting on that understanding to reshape what we do in the classroom. It is about a radical change in the role of teachers. It calls on us to do everything we can to put the student in the foreground of our planning and the execution of those plans in the context of an invitational learning environment characterized by a dynamic community of learners, high-quality curriculum, responsive instruction, informative assessment, and classroom routines that allow for both the flexibility and stability necessary first to meet each learner at their cognitive, affective, and social entry points and then to move each student forward in those areas.",

I am convinced that teachers who learn to develop and lead quality learner-centered classrooms are propelled by the opportunities far more often than they are depleted by the challenges. If teaching is hard and really good teaching is really hard, then really good learner-focused teaching is really, really hard. It is also exquisitely rewarding for both teacher and students.",

Making that transition is perplexing for many teachers because it's so different from the idea of school most of us experienced in our own educational journeys, and because top-down mandates have provided teachers little opportunity to entertain student-centered philosophy and practice.",

Virtually every teacher at the helm of a largely teacher-directed classroom has moments of student-centeredness, and every leader of a highly learner-focused classroom has moments of teacher-directedness. We all fall along a continuum of practice at any given time, and our points on the continuum will shift for a variety of reasons as our careers play out. Nonetheless, student-centered practice calls for us to draw on these beliefs and practices in greater degrees or with a somewhat different focus than we are accustomed to doing.",

Specifically, designers consider two topics: (1) \"the needs and wants of product users\" and (2) \"how [to] satisfy those needs in both functional and emotionally meaningful ways\" (Ruby Garage, 2017, para. 4).

In other words, as a teacher strives to become a better \"student of his or her students,\" a goal of \"Focus on the Learner\" will likely have an impact on \"Learning Environment and Community\" and a strong connection with \"Focus on Progress\" and will produce insights for working with a student more successfully in \"Curriculum and Instruction.\" Likewise, the teacher's focus on the learner at a given time may be intended to help that learner feel more confident in expressing ideas or opinions in class (\"Developing Voice\") but may simultaneously contribute to that student's comfort in \"Participating in a Meaningful Community of Learners\" and \"Identifying as a Learner.\" Note that I have slightly modified the language in Figure 2.2 for use in Figure 3.4 to be a closer match for the vocabulary I'll use in this book.",

That statement, in my opinion, applies to every teacher, but without question it applies to teachers who have signed on to put students at the center of their work. Whatever the orientation points on your particular ethical compass, let's take a moment to look at a few that merit close and ongoing attention as you grow in a student-centered approach to teaching: empathy, equity, fairness, accountability, and values.",

We contribute to the inequities when we see these young people as \"less than,\" when we \"remediate\" them, when we lower expectations for them, when we \"teach down\" to them, when we allow them to fade into the background, and when we give up on them.",

In a second frame, usually labeled \"equality,\" all three children are standing on boxes of equal height. The box doesn't benefit the first child in any way; he could already see over the fence. And while it allows the second child to see over the fence, the shortest child is still looking at boards, not a baseball field. In the third frame, often labeled \"equity,\" the first child is looking over the fence into the field without standing on a box. The second and third children stand on boxes of different heights sized so each can see into the field, too. In some versions of the cartoon, there is a fourth frame. Here, all three children are standing directly on the field looking at the game. The fence is gone. The boxes are no longer necessary, because the barrier has been removed. This frame is labeled \"justice.\" Caring for students implies action on a teacher's part not just to \"provide the right boxes\" but also to contribute doggedly to removing the fences altogether.",

Now think about a colleague or friend who is a great listener and always makes you feel that what you're saying is important enough to merit his or her full attention. Take a step back and consider which life moments have made you feel less than, invisible, incapable, demeaned. Which have made you feel valuable, worthy, stronger, validated, more determined? Why do you think those experiences affected you as they did?",

In a worst-case (but not uncommon) scenario, that orientation leads to stereotyping and dismissing the likelihood that \"those kids\" can succeed or that they even care to. A growth mindset orientation rejects that premise and proposes instead that the human brain is quite malleable; with appropriate encouragement and support, a person can appreciably grow their intellectual capacity just as they can grow their physical capacity. As we'll see in a later chapter, the mindset of a teacher is predictive of that teacher's current pedagogy. It is also a likely predictor of a teacher's current success in extending the reach of every learner and leading a learner-centered classroom.",

It is about taking care to create long-term plans that account for the range of strengths and needs our learners bring to the classroom with them and also about knowing how and when to adapt those long-term plans in the moment as we observe a student's continuing academic, affective, and social development. This is not about becoming \"perfect teachers\"; it's about committing to grow ourselves as observers, thinkers, planners, and responders. It asks of us what we ask of studentsâ€”that we take our own next steps in development as often as we can. As we come to know each of our students in more multidimensional ways, we become more skilled at creating curriculum that is more likely to support engagement and understanding for the individuals we teach and for entire classes of individuals. We learn to speak with greater awareness of the implications of what we say and how we say it. We understand assessment's value as a means to help students develop agency as learners rather than as a method of judging them. We seek opportunities to elicit student voice in more aspects of the work we share and in ways likely to help students develop and trust their own voices.",

He also asked them to incorporate a picture or other image of themselves. \"We'll have time for each of you to share with the class what you've created,\" Mr. Alvarez said. \"This is a way for us to understand one another better as the year begins. We'll build on that understanding throughout the year. I'll post the shields in the room and in the hallway as you finish your presentations.

It affirms or erodes learner self-confidence, builds or diminishes trust in the teacher, fosters or undercuts community, invites or damps intellectual risk taking, commends or disparages learning. It's an intangible entity that's powerful to a degree we can scarcely imagine. The truth is, the learning environment largely determines the degree to which a teacher can realize the vision of students developing their own unique voices, working as partners in success, acquiring and using durable knowledge, identifying as learners, participating in a meaningful community, and aspiring to grow continually (see Figure 3.3, p. 42).",

It employs its only two defenses against the dangerâ€”fight or flightâ€”and essentially shuts down the thinking and reasoning part of the brain (Sousa &amp; Tomlinson, 2018). In fact, the human brain is wired so strongly to connect with others that it often experiences what others are experiencing as though it were happening to them. So, when a teacher is positive and encouraging to one student, others feel that encouragement as well. When a teacher speaks or acts in a way that devalues a student, others are likely to feel diminished as well (DiSalvo, 2013). The mission of a ",

Student trust is earned via the ways in which teachers plan for and enact curriculum, assessment, instruction, and classroom organization practices, all of which we'll examine later in the book. For purposes of this chapter, it is a useful reminder that creating a positive emotional climate, showing sensitivity to student needs, supporting the development of student voice and agency, and creating meaningful opportunity for productive peer interaction are associated with significantly higher gains in student achievement than in comparison classrooms where those characteristics are less evident (Allen et al., n.d.)",

While great numbers of teachers worked heroically and tirelessly, in the face of their own isolation and fears, to develop online learning experiences that could nurture their students' minds and souls, the great aloneness persisted for many students. Returning them to schools and classrooms became a priority, with the expectation that life would be richer and students would feel more fully human when that goal was realized. Yet even when students are once again able to spend most of every school day in the company of peers, many of them find themselves \"alone in a crowd.\" It's far too common, especially at the secondary level, for students to sit side by side in a classroom with little opportunity for meaningful peer interaction. At all grade levels there are also students who feel isolated because of race, language barriers, social immaturity, sexual orientation, learning challenges, home trauma, the clothes they wear, or even because they seem to know too much.",

It's common in group work for some members of the group to have the skill and will to complete assigned tasks quickly and successfully while others in the group lack the skill, confidence, or opportunity to contribute. In those settings, students who are grade-focused and ready for the challenge often co-opt the process and complete the work while the others in the group watch or become frustrated and restless. In the end, the students who did the work are unhappy because the noncontributors \"got credit\" for work they didn't do, and the students who were \"shut out\" of the process feel invisible, judged, rejected, angry, or any one of a host of other negative emotions that are unlikely to draw them to future group collaborations.",

When a teacher helps students learn to rely on and trust one another, the group's resources expand, and everyone gains from the partnership (DiSalvo, 2013). As is the case with forging trust, the goal of building community is to create a context in which students are likely to invest in cognitive, social, and affective learning and maximize their growth and success in those domains. Further, community becomes a proxy for the larger world and provides a place for students to learn to be informed and active citizens working together for the common goodâ€”which is key to a democracy (Love, 2020). Experiencing many years of successful citizenship in classroom communities helps young people develop attitudes, skills, and a sense of responsibility that will serve them and their communities well for years to come.",

They are deliberately kept predictable so the unpredictable can happen\" (p. 32). Said somewhat differently, there is a strong relationship between a teacher's facility in guiding a set of complex activities in a classroom and that teacher's ability to teach the kind of intellectually challenging ideas and skills that are at the heart of a classroom where meaning, relevance, and collaboration are the non-negotiables (Darling-Hammond &amp; Bransford, 2007). They are also essential anytime it's important to focus on the needs of individuals or clusters of individuals rather than on \"the class.\"",

To do those things, teachers must be free, supported, and encouraged to both teach and model the skills and attitudes that can lead students to cognitive, affective, and social success. In this way, we help them acquire the tools they need to better the world.",

At several points in the unit, the teacher deployed the Four Corners instructional strategy to expose students to multiple perspectives. After reading an excerpt from a text and posing a question about it, she asked students to gather in small groups (in designated corners of the classroom) with others who had a similar reaction or response. In these like-minded groups, they talked about their thoughts and feelings for a while, then at an appointed time the students were shuffled into small groups containing representatives from all four corners to talk about their different takes. Finally, students reassembled as a whole class, at which time the teacher reread the originating quote and question. Once again, she asked the students to assemble in the corner corresponding to their current thinking. There, they shared with others the change of perspective they'd had as a result of their group conversations.",

They are \"terrorists,\" \"illegals,\" \"aliens.\" They are \"dangerous,\" \"thugs,\" \"criminal,\" \"freeloaders.\" They are the kids in the low-level classes at school, the causes of the \"achievement gap.\" As early as kindergarten, Pate says, these students are already trying to scale a mountain of guilt that they are unprepared to climb, and the one person who steps forward to help them (their teacher) is someone who's hard for them to trust. The driver of this distrust is the guilt they carry with them.",

It privileges shallow, surface learning over deeper, substantive learning because it robs most learners of opportunities to make meaning, reason, use what they learn in consequential ways, and receive and learn from feedback. Further, when we present acquisition of a standard set of knowledge as synonymous with real learning, many students see what we ask them to learn as unrelated to how they live or to the dreams they have. In one way or another, we lose those students as a result (Love, 2020).",

It's less the road map or mile markers on a journey to a test or to college and career readiness than the shoes students journey in.

It's an assertion that clearly aligns with the goals of student-centeredness. For that sort of learning to occur, it's not enough for students to be compliant and \"receive\" knowledge; they must be fully engaged, which requires that the work they do has inherent meaning for them. With engagement, students are committed enough to persevere with tasks, even when they stumble and get stuck along the way.",

However, \"textbooks are filled with facts that students are expected to memorize, and most tests assess students' abilities to remember the facts\" (National Research Council, 2000, p. 9). All too often, the classroom agenda is about making sure students can recall the information the teacher has shared with them and demonstrate the baseline skills of literacy and numeracy. The common emphasis on high-stakes testing thus tends to narrow both the scope and depth of curriculum, reducing it to little more than a tool for raising test scores (Weiss, 2013). It is important, then, that curriculum specify not only what is essential for students to know and be able to do, but also what understandings they should come to as a result of learning, and that the curriculum itself is a plan for guiding students in both developing and applying the understandings that are at the core of the disciplines they study, using critical knowledge and skills in service of that goal.",

Both are considerably more complex than recalling information and repeating skills. Both give students considerably more agency to make their way through the world. Certainly, life's challenges require more than plugging in what we have memorized; in order to meet the unpredictable, each of us must be prepared to modify, adapt, synthesize ideas and skills, and even create something new with what we initially learned.",

Those two assertions align well with the goals of learner-centeredness, including maximizing student potential and ensuring robust development of student cognitive/intellectual, affective, and social facility in order to construct and live productive and satisfying lives. Achieving those goals requires that students work with curriculum that motivates them to invest themselves in work that will help them make meaning of the world and drives home that what they learn in school is useful far beyond classroom walls.",

There is no single right answer to that question, just as there is no single right curriculum. But there are some trustworthy design guidelines that lead to robust, meaning-rich curriculum. We'll look at three sources for generating such curriculum: (1) focusing on growing student expertise, with particular emphasis on organized knowledge and pattern finding; (2) using \"big ideas\" to support meaning making; and (3) drawing from the nature of the disciplines.

That results in historical cycles with roots in the past and ripples into the future. These cycles are also evident in major aspects of life, such as the arts, science, economics, and philosophyâ€”and in our own personal development.\" Framing the study of history with this concept and flow of ideas made it thought-provoking, easily transferrable to current events, engaging because of its relevance to student interests, and particularly powerful in its connections to their lives.

The curriculum should provide opportunities for students to specializeâ€”to pursue their interests in greater depth than would be required of all students. However, students should not be allowed to discontinue the study of particular subjects until they have experienced enough of the subject to make an informed choice about discontinuing study of that subject. This, in turn, places a burden on schools to provide rich experiences that properly introduce students to the disciplines, so that they know what they are giving up. (p. 6)",

By integrating into our planning the attributes of affiliation, affirmation, novelty, variety, and choice and working collaboratively with our students, we are far more likely to extend the capacities of those students and help them build far more compelling lives than when we teach from a textbook, set of standards, scripted curriculum, or pacing guideâ€”or when our curriculum relies so heavily on student choice that students have little opportunity to learn their way around the world.",

Those three elements areâ€”or should beâ€”so tightly bound together that separating them is not wholly possible. For purposes of understanding the roles and possibilities of each of the three elements in learner-centered classrooms, however, we'll examine them separately in this chapter and the two that follow. Still, you will see moments of merging in all three chapters. It is not possible to fully understand any one of the three elements apart from the curriculumâ€“assessmentâ€“instruction connection (\"CAI connection\"). It is also not possible to develop robust curriculum without understanding the connection. The CAI connection asks us to continually consider these questions:",

Instruction and assessment practices play a critical role in helping students and their teachers see that the learners accomplish the goals of understanding and performing in ways that make the understanding evident.

What I want from my system is a very broad sketch of subjects to teach and the freedom to teach them out of my own design. Define the habits of mind, heart, and work that the community decides are important for all children to develop. Then let me have room to explore the topic with the children. I don't think it is necessary that every teacher teach in the same wayâ€¦. I want to teach out of the natural activity of the class. I want the children to see how learning is the natural activity of people coming together. I want to begin with the students' experience and their own questions, I want them to follow their own interests. But I need to address the content and skills prescribed in the curriculum. Herein lies the art of teaching: leading the students from their own experiences and interests to the depth and breadth of the world within the framework of the subjects I am supposed to teach. I need to find the link that leads the children from their own interests and questions to the areas of the required curriculum. (pp. 28â€“29)",

Any of these avenues to learningâ€”effectively implementedâ€”can support three key goals of student-centered classrooms: (1) maximizing the academic, affective, and social growth of each learner; (2) encouraging student voice and agency; and (3) learning from a robust, discipline-based curriculum that stresses understanding and the transfer of knowledge, understanding, and skills that are foundational for making sense of and contributing to a rapidly changing and uncertain world. To that end, Figure 6.5 provides a framework for planning curriculum, informed by the Understanding by Design (UbD) curriculum planning approach of Wiggins and McTighe (2005).",

They traced how the roots of one cycle very quickly began to suggest potential ripples in another and hypothesized how that time period might influence the next cycle.

Students had considerable choice in how they worked on assignments and how they would demonstrate what they were learning, and their teacher helped them understand and select modes of expression in line with the goals, standards of quality work, and types of thinking prevalent among historians.

He went on to explain that when the curriculum is flat and uninspiring, it is predictable that student learning will generally be flat and uninspiring as well. Next, he introduced formative assessment into the picture by saying that it was just logical that a teacher who cared enough about learners to create a learning environment and a curriculum that were continuously inviting for every student would want to know every day how each student's learning was unfolding. \"So, of course,\" Adam said, \"those teachers just naturally use formative assessment for that purpose.\" He continued, \"I think I just figured this out, but through frequent formative assessment is how teachers know ",

Few schools have moved beyond the sense I had as a novice teacher that judgment is necessary to make sure students are learning what they should learn, that classroom tests are necessary to judge student performance, and that grades are the best way we have of conveying a student's level of performance to the students themselves and to parents, who expect and even demand that the test/grade/report system remain a centerpiece of schools and schooling.

They encourage grade-grubbing instead of learning and are often used by teachers as control mechanisms in spite of a lack of evidence that using grades punitively improves either behavior or achievement. Reeves (2017) lists as the first of five persistent myths about grading that grades motivate students. All in all, it appears we often use grading practices that do little to encourage student growth (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998).",

It's just not smart to tamper with any of them.\" In truth, I suspect the same statement could be made in most U.S. states, with just a little variation in the first and second \"religions.\" Indeed, \"many of the grading practices in U.S. schools are based on tradition, not evidence\" (Brookhart, Guskey, McTighe, &amp; Wiliam, 2020, para. 5).",

Used prior to the start of a new unit of study or inquiry, pre-assessment is quite useful in helping a teacher begin teaching a unit with a reasonable sense of which students may already have knowledge of content that will be introduced and which students lack command of the prerequisite knowledge, understanding, and skill that the teacher might expect students to have acquired via prior learning experiences. Pre-assessments can also help teachers spot misconceptions students have about a topicâ€”valuable insight they can use to steer students toward accurate understandings before the misconceptions become more problematic for learning. When students take a pre-assessment, there is no expectation from the teacher or the students that they should show mastery of the new content. And because most of the content reflected on a pre-assessment has not yet been taught, pre-assessments should not be graded.",

Experts on formative assessment who advocate its use to full effect remind us that the goal of such assessment is to inform adjustment to teaching and learning practices so that students will learn more effectively and efficiently than would have otherwise been the case. Said differently, if a formative assessment does not result in one or both of those changes in the short term, it does not qualify as a formative assessment (Black &amp; Wiliam, 1998; Hattie, 2012).",

If students learned what they were taught, we would never need to assess; we could instead just keep records of what we had taught. But as every teacher knows, many students do not learn what they are taught. Indeed, when we look at their work, we sometimes wonder if they were even present in the classroom. In fact, it is impossible to predict with any certainty what students will learn as the result of a particular sequence of classroom activities. And because we cannot teach well without finding out where our students are starting from, we have to assess. Even if all our students started out at the same point (a highly unlikely situation!), each of them will have reached different understandings of the material being studied within a very short period of time. That is why assessment is the bridge between teaching and learningâ€”it is only through assessment that we can find out whether what has happened in the classroom has produced the learning we intended.

Who might need to go backward to gain competence and confidence with precursor knowledge and skills even as they try to move forward with new content as well? Who is clearly working without sufficient challenge? What is the level of a student's engagement? Confidence? Motivation? Which students seem able to move themselves ahead in the learning process, and which ones seem lost or frozen? Which students are working collaboratively to good effect? Which ones are struggling with skills of collaborationâ€”and which ones are unable to contribute to the success of others in their group? When there is any impediment to forward momentum in learning, the teacher asks, \"What needs to change here to set learning on the right course?\" The focus is, as it should always be, on what's next for a student (Wiliam, 2011c).",

Further on, in the mid-term and long term, formative assessment can help teachers not only communicate and reinforce learning intentions and success criteria but also foster students' ability to choose and employ effective learning strategies, boosting their agency and autonomy and sense of themselves as capable learners. It can even influence student choice of subsequent courses, activities, and careers.",

Exit tickets of any kind can help students reflect on processes as well as content. For example, a 3-2-1 exit ticket might ask students to explain three areas in their current work that they know they could improve, two steps they will take to make those improvements, and one way the teacher could be helpful in supporting those improvements.",

More precisely, feedback should help the student acquire the skills and habits of minds that are characteristic of thoughtful learners, think metacognitively (think about their thinking and how it is or is not working to support success), and become increasingly independent as a learner (Earl, 2013). We recognize this progression as a student's movement along the path toward agency as a learner. Agency is not only a prime goal of learner-centered teaching but also a characteristic of people who have the confidence and skill to successfully tackle many of life's challenges. Understood in that light, feedback in a learner-centered classroom is a systematic, informed, and sustained process of teaching young people how to be learners, problem solvers, and architects of their own success. In Figure 7.4, you'll find a collection of strategies for making feedback useful to your students.",

In other words, a student is most likely to need feedback when a task is \"appropriately challenging,\" which means a little too hard for that student and thus creating some uncertainty about next steps. Feedback is not useful when a student is \"lost in the woods\"; the next step for that student is reteaching. When a task poses little or no challenge for a student, feedback is not necessary (Hattie, 2012); at these times, the best response is to direct students to appropriately challenging work that will be slightly out of reach and, thus, will require feedback to support the reach.",

Those who are working to build basic knowledge and vocabulary need corrective feedback to help them solidify what is correct or incorrect. They may also need assurance that they have support to move ahead. When students have made sense of basic concepts in the content but are not yet seeing connections or extending the basic ideas, it's often beneficial to provide feedback that assures that they are on the right track and are applying the right methods or strategies. In addition, feedback should indicate how they might extend those strategies, or suggest other approaches when their use of a strategy is not productive. Students who are working at advanced levels in a content area will benefit from feedback that points out their effective application of concepts or skills and provides suggestions for continuing to work with abstractions that can lead them to broaden or deepen understanding and applications of the content (Hattie &amp; Yates, 2014).",

Certainly, it's beneficial for a teacher and students to co-construct a list of characteristics of fruitful feedbackâ€”and to revise the list from time to time, based on students' experience in providing and receiving peer feedback. The opportunity to talk about feedback can prompt ongoing thinking about what kind of feedback is most likely to help a peer grow and how to deliver that feedback so peers can listen openly.",

Establishing a learning community based on trust, respect, and partnerships makes both teacher and student feedback more likely to be effective in supporting student growth. What's more, giving students multiple opportunities to learn how to be effective providers and recipients of peer feedback contributes to a sense of community. Extending student agency and voice are central goals of student-centeredness. Both of those attributes are more likely to be realized in a classroom where peer interactions, including providing feedback, are valued and nurtured. At the same time, as peers learn to provide and benefit from peer feedback, they are extending their agency and developing their voices.",

Some students \"learn\" for tests and grades. Some shut down learning to protect themselves from additional failure and pain. Many become co-dependent with grades (Wiliam, 2011a). In fact, students who are motivated to learn because the learning itself is rewarding, and because they believe in their capacity to progress as learners, grow more academically than students who learn for the sake of rewards (Dweck, 2006).",

Guskey (2019) points out that more than 50 years ago, Benjamin Bloom asserted that assigning different levels of \"not-mastery\" is unnecessary. Both Bloom and Carol Dweck (2006) seem to prefer a category called \"not yet.\" In agreement with Berger, and likely Dweck as well, Bloom held the belief that \"given sufficient time and appropriate types of help,â€¦95 percent of students â€¦ can learn a subject to a high level of mastery\" (in Guskey, 2019, para. 9). One part of Bloom's \"appropriate conditions\" is a teacher providing to a student consistent feedback that is both diagnostic (reiterating precisely what a student needed to demonstrate and ways in which the student has met those criteria) and prescriptive (pointing to what the student needs to do next to improve his or her learning).",

Completing the closure stations also allowed all students the experience of becoming their own agents for improving their understanding.

Talking together about pre-assessing students for that concept, the teachers agreed that none of their students would be familiar with symmetry. A pre-assessment on symmetry, they felt, would take valuable class time and yield little information that would be useful in their planning for the unit. The coach who was working with the teachers suggested that they teach and illustrate the concept of symmetry in class for a day and then use a pre-assessment. Reluctantly, the teachers agreed to that plan.",

The instructional practices of the outstanding college teachers in Bain's study absolutely mirror those commended for Kâ€“12 educators in respected research compilations (e.g., Bloom, Hattie, National Research Council) as well as in the writing of education specialists (e.g., Black, Brookhart, Duckworth, Earl, Erickson, Gay, Guskey, Love, Wiggins &amp; McTighe, Wiliam) and education practitioners who write for colleagues who teach in a variety of grade levels (e.g., Berger, France, Levy, Steele).

Our need, as I proposed at the outset of the book, is not to find the next \"new thing\" to add to our teaching repertoires but rather to seek to (1) better understand what we know to do, (2) apply what we have or will come to understand, and (3) invest in the application at as high a level of quality as possible.",

It will have a different feel in a block schedule than in a 49-minute class period. It will have a different tone if the teacher has an exuberant personality than if he or she is quiet and reserved by nature. And whatever the age group, content, or teacher proclivities, instruction in one classroom willâ€”if we take seriously the familiar statement that every student can learnâ€”differ from instruction in every other classroom as the teacher attends to varied learner needs. In fact, because of learner variety and the unpredictability of learning itself, instruction in a particular classroom on any Tuesday morning will (or should) be noticeably different than it will be during the same time period on Wednesday morning.",

It is interesting that very few of these college teachers had any formal training in pedagogy. What they did have was common sense and clarity about what they wanted for their students. They also learned though experience, trial and error, and dogged reflection what was fruitful in accomplishing their vision. In the end, the pivotal element they share is learner-centeredness. All this is encouraging because it suggests that most of us who are teachers can make our way to excellence by following that same path.",

Since beginning his role at UMBC in 1992, he has worked with his colleagues to re-imagine a school that was once a largely unheralded commuter college. Under his leadership, UMBC has become an innovative and successful university. One of its often-celebrated accomplishments is its record of supporting African Americans and other students of color in earning degrees in math and science. Many of those students now play cutting-edge roles in groundbreaking math and science research and applications throughout the United States. Hrabowski has been named one of America's best leaders, one of America's top 10 university presidents, and one of the most influential leaders in the world, among scores of other honors. He chaired President Obama's Advisory Committee on Education Excellence for African Americans and received an honorary doctorate from Harvard.",

All these concepts present challenges for teachers and the \"systems\" in which they teach. All are concepts that educators need to reexamine, see anew, and recommit to in order to become fully learner-centered. Although all of them have appeared in various forms and locations in this book, directly addressing them here is necessary, I believe, to highlight their centrality in achieving the goals of student-centeredness. They are the mortar that binds together everything we've examined to this point.",

Both equity and excellence are variable commodities across contemporary schools, with full access to truly excellent learning opportunities likely far scarcer than many of us would like to admit.",

The struggle to actualize these definitions of equity in the United States (and many other parts of the world) has been protracted and significantly unrealized. Some may continue to debate about whether people who live in poverty are somehow responsible for their own plight or whether it is the result of societal structures that systematically impede opportunity for groups and individuals. It seems to me that we have, and have had, more compelling evidence for the latter, given the numerous inequities consciously and unconsciously embedded in institutions and policies that continue to act as barriers to opportunity that would otherwise be open to all members of a democratic society. In the 19th century, Charles Darwin declared, \"If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin.\"",

It occurred in a first-round qualifying heat in swimming, when a young man representing his small African nation walked onto the pool deck with terror in his eyes. He was a runner who had been recruited by his country to represent it in the Olympic swimming competition so that their slot would not go unfilled.

Rather, both the student and the teacher should be able to see a pathway by which the student can meet the challenging goal.

Appropriate challenge persistently asks a student to take his or her next step in growthâ€”a step that, in the beginning, feels a bit too long. Especially for young people who do not see themselves as learners, the route that leads to excellence demands many next steps to next levels. Those steps involve acquiring the knowledge, understanding, skills, and habits of mind and work that are precursors to excellence. Each step taken, each new level of competency and strength attained, proves to students who doubt themselves that they can do better today than yesterday, better next week than this one, and better this year than they have ever done before. In that way, the steps elicit the motivation to persist.",

There are absolutely times when a student needs to work with a problematic math skill or a reading competency in order to move forward, but those times should not characterize or dominate or dilute the student's academic experience. They should not trigger the creation of identifiable peer groups in which everyone is, or is perceived to be, a low performer. (We'll look further at this point in the next section of the chapter.)",

They teach using a wide range of strategies and approaches. They work to ensure that each student develops the skills of independence, self-direction, collaboration, and production that are necessary for success.

They know that when tasks help students make sense of important ideas, are highly relevant to students' life experiences, and are scaffolded so that they are moderately challenging for students with varied levels of achievement and experience, their students will be motivated to do the hard work that is the hallmark of excellence (Tomlinson &amp; Javius, 2012).",

No one made eye contact with the teacher. Continuing in the same tone, she gave each group a task to do, reminded them to work silently, and stood in the front of the room watching. In one group, students were supposed to collaborate to figure out how to build a specified structure. No student in that group ever spoke. In about 5-minute intervals, she told the students to stand and walk clockwise to the next place their classmates had been working, to sit down quietly and do the work at that place. At the end of an excruciating 40 minutes, the teacher directed the students to \"go back where they belonged when class started\" and to do that silently. When everyone was in place, she barked at the group in her drill-sergeant voice, \"We just did differentiation! Wasn't that fun?\" Every student in the class obediently nodded in affirmationâ€”except one small boy in the back of the room who crossed his eyes, stuck out his tongue, and shook his head back and forth. I wanted to hug that little guy.",

That characterizes how I have come to think about flexibility in the classroom. It does not suggest that flexibility and chaos are kin, as some people fear. Rather, to me, it suggests beginning the day, class period, and school year with your best plan to address the needs of the people you teach in relation to the content you teach. It also suggests to me that no matter how carefully a teacher crafts a lesson or learning experience to be responsive to the varied and continually shifting needs of his or her students, there is likely to be a time (assuming the teacher is observant and willing to act on observation) when something in the plan is not working for someone in the roomâ€”or for several someones.

However, the exit ramps provide the most consistent opportunities to address an individual's learning needs, interests, and talents. Here, a teacher may support the success of an English language learner by front-loading vocabulary or previewing an upcoming article or text chapter, help a student with a learning disability work through or around the problem areas, and spend important time helping a student who is an advanced achiever discover and chart learning frontiers that are well beyond the perimeters of the curriculum. Exit ramps include times when students may be developing particular skills that are necessary for their own forward movement in an inquiry or an upcoming performance task. On exit ramps, a teacher will regularly meet with small groups of students and individual students to help them get back on track after an extended absence from school or to address a misconception that's evident in their work or contributions to class discussion.",

Each of the teachers reviewed their scenarioâ€”again, often several timesâ€”making suggestions for edits so the end result would accurately portray their work as they see it. As a result of these measures, you'll get a much clearer sense of the teacher's voice, beliefs, and reflections than in the earlier and briefer examples that are dependent on my memory of a teacher's work.

One is an elementary school, one is a middle school, and one is a high school. Students are working with biology in one example, with history in another, and with reading and science in the third. Students in one of the schools come almost exclusively from homes in which there is often too little money to feed the family well or provide the kind of \"extras\" that families just a few blocks away take for granted. One of the schools accepts students by lottery without regard to income, race, or neighborhood boundaries. One of the schools is more cross-sectional, serving students who come from a defined but large geographic area and represent a broad range of backgrounds and experiences. In one of the schools, teachers work together almost daily to create and modify interdisciplinary curriculum designed to engage students at multiple grade levels. In another school, teachers use an instructional model developed by a research group to help students learn discipline-based content in conjunction with literacy skills while they develop agency as learners. The third site would probably qualify as a more \"traditional\" school. There, too, teacher creativity is evident in the way teachers work continually to know each student beyond the surface, to know content beyond just the facts, and to craft learning experiences that dignify both the students and the content.",

All three teachers you'll meet shortly would tell you that their work focuses on finding dynamic ways to help young people learn content that can make a difference in their livesâ€”not on preparing students for a test. In all three schools, teachers are treated as professionals accountable to the expectation that they will use their content knowledge, familiarity with the standards derived from that content, and understanding of their students to craft learning experiences that directly address the strengths and needs of individuals and the class as a whole. All three of the teachers who share examples of their work in this chapter focus on cognitive, affective, and social development of their students and teach with a design to foster development of each student in all three of those areas.",

In fact, Emma was so quiet that it took teachers a very long time to realize she had a significant language impairment beyond the challenge of learning a new language. Now, as a result of the bonding that happens among students on their teams and the opportunity teams provide for safe dialogue and contributions, Emma's social skills and confidence have soared. She not only interacts with her teammates consistently as they work together but plays with them as well. The combination of \"push and support\" on the teams gives her much-needed oral language practice and academic vocabulary acquisition and also helps her feel like a contributing part of a teamâ€”accepted, cared about, and supporting the success of every other member.",

Classes are heterogeneous, with learners of all readiness levels and students from all three middle grades (6â€“8) working together. The daily school schedule is very flexible and changes according to the requirements of students' current projects.

At other times, the teachers begin a curriculum planning conversation by sharing a real-world problem, need, invitation, or contest that seems well suited to the interests and needs of their students. In those instances, the teachers \"work backwards\" to consider ways in which important knowledge, understanding, and skills from the content areas (e.g., language arts, social studies, art, science) areâ€”or could beâ€”embedded in a unit that would prepare the way for students to successfully address the ready-made opportunity. Both approaches to curriculum design result in learning experiences that are concept-based, engaging, and focused on student understanding of content and require transfer of knowledge and skill. In both, anchor standards are foundational to student success with the work they do.

Certainly, consistent student enthusiasm for the school, family satisfaction with students' experiences, and teachers' excitement about their work with students are affirmations. It is also validating that from the school's early days through the most recent data, Community Middle School students have outperformed (often markedly) district and state comparison groups on mandated standardized tests. That pattern has been replicated for the cohort of high school students that has recently been added to the school.",

We were ready to keep making buffer for the rest of our lives. We never wanted to stop.\"",

In another class, students bring in samples of fish of varied kinds, both fresh and canned, and test the DNA to see if what they were told they were purchasing was actually what was purchased. In yet again another class, they test their own DNA. Learning this, a prospective student eagerly suggests, \"A DNA database! Let's make a DNA database for students in the class!\"",

In addition, they went on excursions to varied marine sites on the island, worked with scientists at the field station, and attended lectures every evening. The students had just enough spare time to snorkel and swim a bit in the blue waters. Mr. Murphy, she says, \"gave us so many opportunities to learn and grow inside and outside the classroomâ€”and to make memories that will last a lifetime.\"",

So, I use something like a portfolio of their work samples, and I factor growth over time into their grades. Because growth is what matters most.\" As a side note, he mentions that as standardized tests began to dominate teaching and learning, he didn't change a thing about his practice. The reason was simple: \"I don't teach to raise test scores. I teach to help create a hunger to learn, a fascination with the world.\" Perhaps it's not a surprise to learn that Mr. Murphy's students do well on the mandated tests anyhow.",

Schools sort students into layers (which I sadly heard a small group of educators refer to as \"the definitlies,\" \"the maybes,\" and \"the no-hopes\"). The maybes and the no-hopes are seldom pushed to excel. They can opt out of classes that don't seem to be \"their thing.\"",

Let me provide the opportunity and support to elicit that capacity.\" Student-centeredness, rightly understood and implemented, seeks to uplift the humanity of each young person, to place the welfare of each young person at the center of all decisions, and to equip each young person not just to survive in school and in life, but to matter and to thrive (Love, 2020).",

I too feel passionately about the need for this transformation. Many of the articles are compellingly written, and many introduce me to strategies and technologies that sound promising and that I am excited to learn about. In nearly all of the articles, however, I detect a certain reductivism. Invariably, the argument seems to be that if we just adopted this set of apps or inquiry learning or problem-based learning or project-based learning or flexible schedules or flipped classrooms or community-based learning or personalization or standards-based learning or hybrid learning that combines technology and in-person meetings or any one of several dozen other \"solutions,\" we would see education revitalized. We have no reason, based on research or experience, to conclude that is the case.

Longtime residents have been displaced and businesses have been shuttered. The physical Black Diamond is long gone. Crime, addiction, death, and incarceration have torn families apart. Neighborhood schools have struggled to retain staff, and students have struggled to achieve. Alongside the hurt has been a constant pressure to stay on guard. This pressure has left this neighborhood exhausted, and many of my students have inherited this fatigue.

Rasheedat begins with some affirmation and appreciation of the students. She acknowledges that the process ahead might feel strange, might trigger vulnerability and spark doubt. Rasheedat asks for presence, open-mindedness, and a degree of participation. She tells the students they will have opportunities to speak, though they can pass when their turn comes around. Ultimately, though, we will all be voting to adopt some agreements that we will be constructing together, and we will all be signing our names to those agreements.",

Above that, at the Wisdom level, students are invited to transfer their understanding. They are told they are living in Miami, Florida. First, they have to identify a business they want to establish. Then they have to answer this question: ",

But now I think it makes sense to put the club in a spot where people are already going.\" Smart. Derrick proceeds to tell me he wants a map of all the burglaries in Miami, a map of all the hotels, and a map of all the Waffle Houses. (He says everyone he knows winds up at Waffle House at 3 a.m. after clubbing.) Derrick justifies each map with similar precision. He explains he will put all four maps on top of each other. \"My GIS will help me see the safe spots in the city near hotels and Waffle Houses where people are already looking to party. It'll squish all my little maps together, and I'll be able to see which places in the city have more of the assets I want.\"",

What the boys mean by \"help\" could not be less defined. Catalina and Fernanda have many options: ask them to be more specific, modify the terms of the proposal, or just decline the offer. But I think they are feeling empowered by the requestâ€”and not just in the context of the game. I think Catalina and Fernanda feel seen and valued by their classmates, and that matters. Also, the state of Ix-Zamna has a compelling humanitarian code, and Madaki is clearly a state in need. So the principled young women agree. Both sides draft an alliance contract in Spanish and in English and sign it. I make official the transfer of CPs and resources, and Madaki immediately takes its health infrastructure from level 2 to level 3. That means better protection against Ebola. The defense systems they are also hoping to develop will have to wait.",
